>> **Exercise 2.4
Using the variable totalwgt_lb, investigate whether first ba-
bies are lighter or heavier than others.  Compute Cohenâ€™s d
to quantify the difference  between  the  groups.   How  does
it  compare  to  the  difference  in pregnancy length?**

firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()
