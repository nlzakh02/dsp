[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> For the following exercises, you can start with chap04ex.ipynb.
My solution is in chap04soln.ipynb.

>> Exercise 4.2
The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform
between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the
same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and
plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

# Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random

sample = np.random.random_sample(1000)

# Plot their PMF

pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample)

thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf])
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Number', ylabel='PMF')

# Plot their CDF

cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)

thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Number', ylabel='PMF')
