[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

__Exercise 4.2  
The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.  
Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random and plot their PMF. What goes wrong?  
Now plot the CDF. Is the distribution uniform?__

```
# Generate 1000 numbers from numpy.random.random
sample = np.random.random_sample(1000)

# Plot their PMF
pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample)
thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf])
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Number', ylabel='PMF')
```

This blue rectangle is a result of many blue bars  denoting equal frequencies for values generated by ```random``` function.

```
# Plot their CDF
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)
thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Number', ylabel='PMF')
```

For the uniform distribution we would expect CDF plot to be linear. Our actual plot is quite close to being linear and appears to be fairly uniform.
